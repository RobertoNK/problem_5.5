Problem 5 Chapter 5
Book: Java programming from the beginning 

Make the following changes to the PhoneDirectory program(
section 5.8):

(a) Add a command named d (delete). It will prompt the user
for a name and then delete all phone records that match the
name. (As with the f command, partial matches are allowed)

(b)Set the initial size to the records array to 1, instead of
100, and have the program double the size of the array each
time it becomes full

(c) Modify the f command so that it lines up names and numbers in
colums:

Abernathy, C		779-7559
Abbot, C Michael	776-5188

Allow 25 characters for the name: Hint: Create a String
containing 25 spaces. Use the substring method to select a
portion of the string to display between the name and
number.
